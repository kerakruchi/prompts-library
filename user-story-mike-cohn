### User Story [User Story Number ID]:

- **Summary**: [brief, memorable, human-readable story title with how we're providing value to the persona]

#### Use Case:
- **As a** [user name if available, otherwise user persona, otherwise user role or title],
- **I want to** [action user takes to get to outcome],
- **so that** [desired outcome by the user].

#### Acceptance Criteria:
<!--
Note 1: Givens are pre-conditions, so don't feel limited to just 3 Givens.
Note 2: There should only be one "When" and one "Then" statement that aligns with the use case's "I want to" action and "so that" outcome.
Note 3: Multiple "when" and "then" are good indicators that a story must be split; see `user-story-splitting-prompt-template.md`
