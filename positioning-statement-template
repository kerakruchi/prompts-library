## Positioning Statement Template

<!-- generate a Geoffrey Moore-style positioning statement using the following template -->

### Value Proposition

**For** [target customer/user (think persona)]
- **that need** [statement of the user's underserved need (consider pains, gains, jobs to be done)]
- [name of the product or service (if one is not provided, create a compelling product name)]
- **is a** [definition of the product category]
- **that** [statement of benefit to the user (focus on outcomes, not features)].

### Differentiation Statement

- **Unlike** [primary competitor or competitive area/market/arena],
- [name of the product or service]
- **provides** [how the product or service is uniquely differentiated (again, focus on outcomes, not features)].
